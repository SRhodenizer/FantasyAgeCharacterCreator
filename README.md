Since Heroku removed their MongoDB plugin, I no longer have an online version of this project.

To launch this project locally you need to follow the steps below:

1. Open 4 seperate command windows and use the cd command to navigate them to the project folder.
2. Download MongoDB and run mongod.exe
3. In one window type 'npm run watchLoginBundle'
4. In the next window type 'npm run watchAppBundle'
5. In the next window type 'npm run watchAccountBundle'
6. Then in the last command window type 'npm run nodemon'
7. Open your browser of choice and navigate to localhost:3000
